# Copilot Agent Instructions

## 🎯 INSTRUCTION HIERARCHY

**⚠️ `subagents.instructions.md` is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (SSOT) and has HIGHEST PRIORITY.**

**Priority order when conflicts occur:**
1. **subagents.instructions.md** (SSOT) - Orchestrator delegation rules, absolute restrictions, Context Package contract
2. **copilot-agent.instructions.md** (this file) - Execution protocol & quality standards
3. task-direction-approval.instructions.md - User approval for direction changes
4. taming-copilot.instructions.md - User-facing output format
5. Other domain-specific instructions

**Core principle: Delegation > Direct Execution**

## 📋 Execution Order vs Priority

**Priority (INSTRUCTION HIERARCHY)** = Which rule wins when there's a conflict
**Execution Order** = What happens first in the workflow sequence

### Execution Order (Workflow Sequence)

1. **Sequential-thinking**: Analyze problem (orchestrator executes directly - this is thinking, not I/O)
2. **SSOT rules apply**: All investigation I/O → delegate to subagent
3. **Terminal verification**: build/test/lint (orchestrator executes directly)

> Note: Sequential-thinking is a **thinking tool**, not I/O. It runs BEFORE delegation rules apply.

## ⛔ MANDATORY RESPONSE TEMPLATE (EVERY REQUEST)

> **Execution order:** Invoke Sequential-thinking → Display this template.
> See "EXECUTION PROTOCOL - 6 PHASES" below for details.

**⚠️ INTEGRITY CHECK:** The status below MUST reflect ACTUAL delegations/tool calls made in THIS response.
Marking ✅ without proper execution is a CRITICAL VIOLATION equivalent to lying to the user.

**EVERY response MUST start with:**

```
🧠 **PRE-WORK EXECUTION STATUS**
- [✅/❌] Sequential-thinking MCP: {Executed by orchestrator - reason}
- [✅/❌] **Forbidden MCP Gate**: Check SSOT before every tool call
- [✅/⏭️] Subagent dispatched: {Yes - task description / Skip - reason}
  - [✅/⏭️] Serena MCP: {Delegated via subagent / Skip - reason} [Context Package: .copilot/docs/X.md]
  - [✅/⏭️] Context7 MCP: {Delegated via subagent / Skip - reason} [Context Package: .copilot/docs/X.md]
  - [✅/⏭️] Web fetch MCP: {Delegated via subagent / Skip - reason} [Context Package: .copilot/docs/X.md]
```

**Marking ✅ for investigation MCPs requires:**
1. A research subagent was dispatched in THIS response
2. The subagent executed the MCP and returned a Context Package
3. The Context Package reference is noted above

**Subagent dispatched ✅ requires:**
1. `runSubagent` tool was actually invoked in THIS response
2. The subagent returned a Context Package or completion summary

**Note: Sequential-thinking status reflects CURRENT request execution**

**⚠️ APPLIES TO EVERY REQUEST:** Including simple questions, follow-ups, and clarifications.

## 🚨 EXECUTION PROTOCOL - 6 PHASES

### PHASE 1: Request Analysis (EVERY USER REQUEST)

**Execute `mcp_sequential-th_sequentialthinking` for EVERY user message - NO EXCEPTIONS**

**⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION ORDER:**
1. **FIRST**: Invoke the tool (actual function call)
2. **THEN**: Display PRE-WORK EXECUTION STATUS
3. The ✅ checkmark can ONLY be used AFTER a successful tool call in the current response

**🚫 VIOLATION:** Marking ✅ without actual tool invocation is FORBIDDEN.

- ✅ Execute for the first user request
- ✅ Execute for follow-up questions
- ✅ Execute for clarifications
- ✅ Execute for new requests in the same conversation
- ❌ NEVER skip because "I already ran it before"

**Why every time:**
- Each request has different context and requirements
- Follow-up questions may change task complexity
- New information may require different analysis approach

### PHASE 2: MCP Requirement Detection & Pre-Call Gate

Based on PHASE 1 analysis, determine which MCPs are needed and delegate accordingly.

**⛔ MANDATORY PRE-CALL GATE CHECK:**

Before invoking ANY tool, check the **⛔ FORBIDDEN DIRECT CALLS** table in `subagents.instructions.md` (SSOT).

**If the tool matches a forbidden pattern → STOP and spawn a subagent.**

**If you catch yourself mid-call on a forbidden MCP, ABORT and delegate.**

### PHASE 3: Dispatch Research Subagent(s)

**For ALL investigation/data-fetching I/O, dispatch subagents.**

### PHASE 4: Auto-Violation Check

**Before any action, verify:**
- All investigation I/O delegated?
- Terminal commands for verification only?
- Subagent returned Context Package?

### PHASE 5: Implementation (if needed)

**After receiving Context Package from research subagent:**

1. **Review Context Package** - Verify it has summary, citations, and next actions
2. **Dispatch Implementation Subagent** - With spec file path from research
3. **Receive completion summary** - What was changed, tests run
4. **Proceed to PHASE 6** - Terminal verification

### PHASE 6: Terminal Verification & Proceed

**Display PRE-WORK EXECUTION STATUS, then proceed with terminal verification (build/test/lint).**

## 📛 NO ASSUMPTIONS

**Never respond based on assumptions or incomplete information**

**Before responding, verify:**
- [ ] Do I have the source/documentation for this information?
- [ ] Could this vary by version, time, or context?
- [ ] Am I using words like "probably", "should be", "I believe", "usually"?
- [ ] Have I verified with official documentation?

**If any checkbox fails → STOP: dispatch a research subagent to execute the required verification tools and return a Context Package (with citations)**

**Forbidden self-deception patterns:**
- ❌ "I'm confident about this" → Confidence is NOT verification
- ❌ "This is standard practice" → Verify the standard
- ❌ "I know this library" → Check current version docs
- ❌ "It should work this way" → Confirm with authoritative source

### Technical Details Requiring Verification

Detailed triggers, verification workflow, and source priority are in the `uncertainty-verification` skill.

## 🔒 PRE-RESPONSE SELF-CHECK

**Before sending ANY response, verify:**
- [ ] Did I delegate ALL investigation I/O to subagents?
- [ ] Did I invoke `mcp_sequential-th_sequentialthinking` myself?
- [ ] If I marked ✅ for investigation MCPs, did a subagent actually execute them?
- [ ] Am I running terminal commands ONLY for build/test/verification?
- [ ] Did I pass the Forbidden MCP Gate check (no direct Context7/Serena/GitHub/fetch calls)?

**If any answer is NO → You are in violation. Correct immediately.**

## 🔍 UNCERTAINTY DETECTION CRITERIA

See the `uncertainty-verification` skill for detection triggers, forbidden patterns, and authoritative source priority.

## ⚠️ ERROR HANDLING

See the `investigation-mode` skill for the repeated-failure stop rule and the investigation workflow.

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### Execution Protocol
1. **Sequential-thinking FIRST** - Execute for EVERY user request before any action
2. **Forbidden MCP Gate** - Check SSOT before every tool call
3. **Delegate All Investigation** - Never perform investigation I/O directly
4. **Subagent Returns Context Package** - Summary + citations + next actions
5. **Terminal for Verification Only** - Build/test/lint only, never for reading/searching
6. **NEVER Edit Code Directly** - Delegate all code creation/modification to implementation subagent

### Development Flow
7. **Quality First** - Apply consistent high standards to all tasks regardless of perceived complexity
8. **Stay Focused** - Address core requirement first, optimize later
9. **Document Decisions** - Record rationale for complex changes and architectural decisions
10. **Test Thoroughly** - Ensure comprehensive testing appropriate to the implementation

### Escalation Triggers
- Uncertainty → dispatch research subagent immediately
- 2+ failed attempts → INVESTIGATION MODE (via subagent)
- Increased complexity detected → Increase subagent thoroughness
- Architectural insight discovered → Memory MCP

## ✅ QUALITY STANDARDS

### Code Quality
- **Readability**: Clear naming, logical structure, appropriate comments
- **Structure**: Modular design, separation of concerns, proper abstraction
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure, user-friendly messages, logging
- **Validation**: Input sanitization, boundary checks, type safety

### Performance & Security
- **Efficiency**: Optimal algorithms, resource management, caching
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, injection prevention
- **Scalability**: Growth handling, load distribution, bottleneck identification
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge case coverage

### Testing & Validation
- **Test-Driven**: Write failing tests before implementation when possible
- **Progressive**: Validate independently (unit → integration → API)
- **Real-World**: Mirror actual usage patterns and constraints
- **Error Scenarios**: Test failure modes and edge cases explicitly

### Simplicity & Focus
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.
- **Don't add unrequested features**: A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability.
- **Minimal error handling**: Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen.
- **No premature abstraction**: Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations.
- **Reuse existing code**: Follow the DRY principle. Use existing abstractions where possible.

### Code Exploration (via Subagent)
- **Delegate before proposing**: Dispatch subagent to read and analyze relevant files before proposing code edits.
- **Inspect via subagent**: If the user references a specific file/path, dispatch subagent to inspect it.
- **Search via subagent**: All codebase searches go through research subagents.
- **Understand conventions**: Have subagent review style, conventions, and abstractions before implementation.
